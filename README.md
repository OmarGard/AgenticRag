# AgenticRag
 This repository demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using LLaMA3 for local question answering with fallback and self-correction mechanisms. The project integrates several RAG strategies based on key papers, and runs a local LLaMA3 model to retrieve documents and generate responses.
